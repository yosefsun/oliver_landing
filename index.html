      <p class="lead">Goodbyes are never easy. This one especially.</p>

      <p class="">When we set to start Oliver, we had a clear mission - we believed that renting an apartment should be easy, frictionless and maybe one day, even fun…</p>

      <p class="">Together with a group of exceptional investors who believe in us and a killer team of developers and ops we set to conquer Manhattan first and eventually any big city in the world.</p>

      <p class="">
      We worked rigorously to meet the goals we set to ourselves and 3 month in, we alert had more than 100 showings per day, taking place through the Oliver platform.
      </p>

      <p class="">
      As we were scaling, we always set to find the best business model for the economy we are at. We’ve been playing with different models - charging a small service fee, charging a landlord per portfolio and eventually charging the landlord per lease.
    </p>

      <p class="">
      We found out that the unit economics we were involved with will require a significant amount of capital to prove itself, and even with the right amount of capital and investors, hyper-local scaling will require even more capital which won’t make the business profitable anytime soon.
    </p>

      <p class="">
      Until we figure out a better way to disrupt the consumer facing real-estate realm we decided to, sadly, discontinue the Oliver apps and platform.
    </p>

      <p class="">
      Thank you for all the love and support along the way.
